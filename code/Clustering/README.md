The main purpose of our project is to analyse the clusters produced by applying k-means clustering on weather data. 
In this project we use four variables namely temperature, dew point, wind speed, station pressure in order to group stations which have similar weather.

Description of code files:

clustering_2007.r: This file contains the code which pre-processes the data set and performs k-means on the 2007 data set.
clustering_2008.r: This file contains the code which pre-processes the data set and performs k-means on the 2008 data set.
clustering_2009.r: This file contains the code which pre-processes the data set and performs k-means on the 2009 data set.
YeartoYear.r:  This file contains the code to compare jaccard coefficient between clusters obtained from three different years.
