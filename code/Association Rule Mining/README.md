The main purpose of our project is to analyse the association rules produced by applying the apriori algorithm on the data collected from retail data of store purchases.

File Descriptions:

apriori.r: This file contains the code which applies apriori algorithm and generates frequent item sets and association rules. It also contains code to visualize the generated outputs.

market_basket_transactions.csv: This file contains the processed data set which are ready to be read as transactions.
